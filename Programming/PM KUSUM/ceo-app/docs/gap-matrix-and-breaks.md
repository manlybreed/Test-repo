# Rule 46 gap matrix & breaking changes

## Breaking changes vs previous Invoice model

| Previous | Compliant target |
|----------|------------------|
| Global `INV-09` via single `InvoiceSequence` | Per-FY / per-series counters |
| Hard-delete any invoice | DRAFT-only delete; ISSUED retained |
| Content mutable after create | ISSUED content locked; payment/TDS only |
| Loose buyer GSTIN / no POS field | Rule 46 validation before issue |
| Header-only tax; no stored POS | Store `placeOfSupply*`, RCM, round-off |
| `clientId` unused in form | Match Client when possible; optional Agreement |
| “Unpaid” / delete as refund | Refund via Credit Note (or RFV for advances) |
| Import keeps external PDF only | Prefer validated draft → BluRidge PDF on issue |
